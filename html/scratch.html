            <ul>
                <li>If you don’t have your own snowshoes, join a guided snowshoe tour led by a park ranger or a local outfitter. The Yosemite Conservancy often offers guided walks to places like Yosemite Valley and Glacier Point.</li>

            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Yosemite in the winter is a photographer’s dream. Capture the beauty of frozen waterfalls, snow-covered trees, and winter sunsets over iconic landscapes like Tunnel View and Cook’s Meadow.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Ice Skating at Tenaya Lake</li>
            <ul>
                <li>On colder winter days, the Tenaya Lake can freeze over, providing a scenic, natural ice skating rink. Always check with park authorities for ice thickness and safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
